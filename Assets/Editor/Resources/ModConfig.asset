    from the old version[/url].\n\nSimon Sounds is a version of the popular Simon
    Says game. In this version you won\u2019t see which button Simon pressed, but
    you will hear the sound this particular button generates.\r\n\r\nOn the top of
    the module you will find 4 sample buttons. Press them to hear the sound they generate
    and figure out which button Simon pressed.\r\n\r\nREMEMBER: The colours of the
    sample buttons AS WELL as the input buttons are messed up! \r\n\r\nCreated by
